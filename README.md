The BioProviders Type Provider for GenBank allows type-safe access and exploration of the server's structure and data files. This provides the ability to search for genomic assemblies based on taxon (e.g., bacteria, invertebrate), species (e.g., Staphylococcus_borealis) and assembly (e.g. GCA_003042555.1_ASM304255v1).
